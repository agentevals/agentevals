title: Criteria vs Rubrics
description: When to use criteria, rubrics, or both
---

The `criteria` and `rubrics` fields serve distinct but complementary roles in defining what makes a successful evaluation.

## Quick Reference

| Scenario | `criteria` | `rubrics` | Result |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Simple check | Required | — | criteria is the sole evaluation signal |
| Structured scoring | Optional | Required | rubrics drive scoring; criteria adds context |
| Code judge only | — | — | `evaluators` sufficient |

## criteria

High-level description of what a correct response should contain.

```yaml
tests:
  - id: math-check
    criteria: Correctly calculates 15 + 27 = 42
    input: What is 15 + 27?
```

When no rubrics are defined, `criteria` acts as the sole evaluation criterion. Implementations may auto-promote it to a single rubric item.

When rubrics ARE defined, `criteria` serves as a high-level seed — context for LLM judges and tooling that generates rubrics from natural language.

## rubrics

Structured evaluation criteria with optional weights and score ranges.

**String shorthand** — same ergonomics as criteria, but multiple items:
```yaml
rubrics:
  - Mentions divide-and-conquer approach
  - Explains the partition step
  - States time complexity correctly
```

**Object form** — weighted, with specific outcomes:
```yaml
rubrics:
  - id: accuracy
    outcome: Correctly calculates the sum
    weight: 2.0
  - id: explanation
    outcome: Shows working steps
    weight: 1.0
```

**Score ranges** — analytic scoring:
```yaml
rubrics:
  - id: factual_accuracy
    weight: 2.0
    score_ranges:
      0: Contains major factual errors
      8: Accurate, covers key points
      10: Fully accurate, no distortions
```

## When Both Are Present

```yaml
tests:
  - id: quicksort-explain
    criteria: Provide a clear explanation of how quicksort works
    input: Explain quicksort
    rubrics:
      - Mentions divide-and-conquer approach
      - Explains partition step
      - States time complexity
```

Here, `criteria` provides high-level context while `rubrics` define the specific checkpoints. The rubrics drive scoring — criteria supplements but does not replace them.

## Validation

At least one of these must be present:
- `criteria`
- `rubrics`
- `evaluators` (for code judges or custom evaluators)
